API Basics
You should never receive an error unless the server is overloaded or the search dies. In cases of the searcher breaking, you will receive a response success of "false" and a message stating "search down" or similiar.

API Keys
URL to request API key: https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=account&s=options

user_id: Enter the ID of your user
api_key: The API key
API limits may be changed at any time. If you run an application that requires higher limits, you can request an unlimited key. This is only applicable for large public project.
If it's a big Site/App that's more urgent make a ticket on our Discord or alternatively you can site mail staff. https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=forum&s=view&id=4240
We reserve the right to disable or deny any key.

API Terms of service

When using the rule34.xxx API or if you serve content from our CDN, you will not display any advertisements or run paywalls. This applies to all bots, apps, and websites.
Do not use or request more than one API key. Using multiple keys will result in a suspension of your key or account.
